##Cat vs Dog Classifier (Streamlit App)
A lightweight deep learning app that predicts whether an uploaded image is a cat or a dog, built with PyTorch and deployed using Streamlit Cloud.



## What It Does
Classifies images as either Cat 🐱 or Dog 🐶

Uses a MobileNetV2 model trained on a mini dataset

Runs entirely in your browser — no installations needed

Easy and beginner-friendly to try out and understand

## How It Works
A pretrained MobileNetV2 model was fine-tuned on a small Cats vs Dogs dataset.

The model was trained and saved using Kaggle Notebooks + GPU.

A simple Streamlit app loads the model and classifies user-uploaded images.
